Introduction/Business problem


Introduction:
The Google Fiber company provides high-speed internet to homes and businesses through their fiber-optic services, which are advertized as faster and more reliable than traditional internet connections. However, they have recently been experiecing an increased volume of complaint calls from customers and are interested in effectively communicating with customers, increasing customer satisfaction, and improving operational efficiency. The purpose of this project is to analyze a fictional dataset provided and create a dashboard allowing for repeat calls to be tracked based on the specifications of the Google Fiber customer service team.

Requirements:

• A chart or table measuring repeat calls by their first contact date

• A chart or table exploring repeat calls by market and problem type

• Charts showcasing repeat calls by week, month, and quarter

• Provide insights into the types of customer issues that seem to generate more repeat calls

• Paste repeat caller trends in the three different market cities

• Design charts so that stakeholders can view trends by week, month, quarter, and year. 

The first chart records repeat calls by week over a fourteen-week period broken down by how many days it has been since initial contact. Calls are further broken down by the type of call received from one of the five categories: construction, scheduling, account management, technician troubleshooting, and Internet and Wi-Fi. Selecting a point on the bar charts allows the specific amount of repeat calls to be determined. After the initial call, the majority of problems were resolved, indicated by the subsequent drop-off of calls.

The second chart shows the breakdown of call reasons grouped by the three service areas surveyed. Filters for service area, problem type, and market allow for greater degrees of granularity. Selecting a point on a pie chart allows for the specific amount of calls to be determined. Market received the most calls by far, followed by market 2 and market 3.

The third chart records repeat calls broken down by initial contact date and service area.Calls can be further proken down by problem type and the day of date created. Selecting a point on a line chart allows for the specific amount of calls to be determined. Depending on the problem type different markets saw different spikes in initial calls through time.
